# libJSON
Just another JSon library

## Motivation
I wanted a lightweight, multiplatform, with no external dependencies library
(Not a header, but a library) capable of handle big JSON files. As a bonus track, 
I wanted to have similar sintax than the reference Java library...

And here we are, a C++17 library.

## Requirements
The solution brings two projects:
- The library itself has no dependency.
- The tester project uses [TinyCppUnit](https://github.com/IgnacioPomar/TinyCppUnit). 


## Authors
- Ignacio Pomar Ballestero



## Building
At this stage, only with visual studio
